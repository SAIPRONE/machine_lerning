## 1. Introduction

This self-assessment aims to reflect on my current knowledge and skills in programming, with a particular focus on data structures and algorithms, as part of my professional development. My experience in automated testing and software engineering in the robotics and automation industry has provided me with a solid foundation in problem-solving and software development. This assessment covers my understanding and application of data structures and algorithms in my projects and outlines my objectives for further growth in this area.

## 2. Skills

My professional journey as an Automated Testing Engineer at Visual Components has honed my skills in programming languages such as C++, C#.NET, and Python. I have utilized these languages extensively to develop and test automation solutions, primarily in the context of robotics and AI/ML engineering. While my proficiency in these languages is a strength, my exposure to complex data structures and advanced algorithms has been more applied and less theoretical.

In terms of data structures, I have worked with arrays, lists, and dictionaries in Python, as well as similar structures in C++ and C#. My understanding of algorithms is mostly related to those I have encountered in automation and robotics projects, such as pathfinding algorithms (e.g., A* or Dijkstra's algorithm) and basic sorting and searching algorithms.

## 3. Learning

Before this course, my learning has been project-driven and focused on practical applications in automation and robotics. I have a solid understanding of basic data structures and algorithms but recognize the need to deepen my theoretical knowledge and broaden my application skills in more complex scenarios.

## 4. Objectives

My primary goal in this course is to strengthen my theoretical foundation in data structures and algorithms and to learn how to effectively apply this knowledge in solving complex problems, particularly in the fields of robotics and AI/ML. I aim to master advanced data structures (e.g., trees, graphs, heaps) and understand their applications in optimizing algorithms for real-world tasks. Additionally, I plan to enhance my skills in algorithmic thinking, with a focus on dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and graph algorithms.

## 5. Conclusion

This self-assessment has provided an opportunity to introspect on my current capabilities and set clear objectives for my learning journey in data structures and algorithms. As I progress through this course, I aim to bridge the gap between my practical experience and theoretical knowledge, thereby enhancing my expertise in developing more efficient and sophisticated software solutions in the field of robotics and automation.
