# Machine learning Assignments

## Spring 2024 implementation

In this GitLab Repository, you can find the bases of the ML course assignments as **Jupyter Notebook** files.

### Student's name or Students' names

**INSERT THE NAMES OF THE GROUP MEMBERS HERE!**. So add *student's name or students' names and student IDs at JAMK*.

     # Enter your information here!
     student_name = 'Fadi Helal' # Your name
     student_id = '2312951' # Your student ID at JAMK

### Repository Forking

1. **Fork** the assignment repository for yourself
2. Change the repository permissions. Always create a **Private** repository, because the solutions to the assignments should not be visible to other students. If your repository is not private, the course is rejected.
3. Set the repository access rights to only yourself, your possible group work student and the course teacher (**Developer** rights) when you are starting to do the assignments.
4. Change the student's name to the forked repository before starting to do assignments.

### Group work

These assignments can be done and returned in pairs.
This is particularly advantageous in analyzing and reflecting on the results,
which is an important part of any machine learning project.

* Grading for a group work is the same as for work done alone.
* In group work, it will be enough that you return one repository that was developed together with a teammate.

## Return of Jupyter Notebooks

**NOTE! Do not change the basic structure of Original Jupyter Notebook files when returning assignments to the repository.**

Of course, you can develop the solution to the assignments with just _Python_ for easier debugging,
but the exercise will always be returned in Jupyter Notebook format.

In Jupyter Notebook file, the Python _code cells_ are run before the assignment is returned to the Repository.

In this way, the results of the Notebook's **output** cells are displayed directly when checking assignments.

Good Luck!
