# Deep learning - assignments

* Spring 2024 assignments for TTC8060.

### Student's name or Students' names

In this GitLab Repository, you can find the templates of the Deep Learning assignments as **Jupyter Notebook** files.

Move the student's name/names to all **Jupyter Notebook** (_ipynb_)
files to the forked repository right at the beginning of the assignment.

### student_name = 'Fadi Helal'
### student_id = '2312951'
### AB4250@student.jamk.fi


## Assignment templates

This repository contains the templates of the assignments for the Deep Learning course in **Jupyter Notebook** format.
Corrections may come to the repository later, so it is worth checking before returning assignments. 
No minor text changes
it is worth copying to the assignments to be returned, but the assignment text corrections should still be checked.

## Editing Jupyter Notebook in assignments

IMPORTANT! *Do not change the basic structure of Jupyter Notebook files when returning assignments to the repository.*

* New code or document cells can be added as needed, because this course does not have an automatic checking for notebook files.
* you should prefer not to create very many new cells, because the necessary cells can mainly be found in the assignment documents!
* The original order of Python code and MarkDown cells in the Notebook should be kept.

### Forking and rights

**Fork** the repository for yourself (always make a **Private** repository) and set the rights only for yourself,
to a possible other member of the group (can be done in "groups" of 1-2 students) and to the course teacher immediately,
when you are starting to do the assignments.

Give the teacher **Developer** rights to your assignment repository as soon as possible.
