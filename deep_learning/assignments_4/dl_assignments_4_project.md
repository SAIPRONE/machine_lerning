# Assignment 4 - Deep learning Final Project (15 p)

The most motivated students of Deep Learning can get the best possible grade by doing this
Final Project for Deep Learning course.

The starting point is that the project work is worth doing if:
* You like challenging tasks
* Exceptional motivation for artificial intelligence studies
* Good or excellent basic knowledge of other AI&DA study courses
* Enough time to do project and to document & analyze the results

Note! **Final Project** is deep learning for the first time in the course, so it is not necessary to describe it
not be completely successful. You can apply the following subtasks freely.
The maximum score for this assignment is **15 points**.

## Assignment 4-1
### Topic: Implementation plan for deep learning + selection of material (3 points)

1. Choose your data for the assignment freely, for example, based on your own interest or work.
   1. Get to know the data properly
   2. It's better if you know the domain
2. Preprocess the data
    1. Optimize the data input to the machine learning model
    2. you can remove "unnecessary features" at your discretion
3. Scale the data
4. Select a class variable or target value
5. Visualize the data with a few different figures.

## Assignment 4-2
### Topic: Implementation of deep learning (8 points)

1. Select the applicable deep learning model for the assignment
    1. You can try, for example, two different deep learning architecture
2. Divide the data into training and testing data
3. Implement deep learning with the selected algorithm
    1. Deep learning model, preferably something else that is used in the basic assignments of the course.
    2. It can also be found from outside the course lectures
4. Calculate the prediction accuracy and confusion matrix of the classification result

Note! it is worth keeping a notebook in which you collect the results of different runs (accuracies, run times, model configuration, etc.)

## Assignment 4-3
### Topic: Analysis of results (4 p)

1. Analyze learning results of the Model(s)
2. How deep learning with different methods went for the selected data and the selected deep learning methods
3. How well did the method work?
4. What do you notice that needs to be developed in the deep learning model (document possible areas of development)?
5. How could you optimize a deep learning model?
6. Other considerations about the assignment?
